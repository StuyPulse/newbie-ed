# Java Resources 

<p> Here are a bunch of resources for learning and practice Java. I (aka Tahsin) have used all these resources at some point so I can attest to them being good (or bad). </p>

## Learning Java 
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/">GeeksforGeeks</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm">TutorialsPoint</a>
        <p> Whenever you serach up something in Java these are probably the first things that'll come up. They're kind of good for getting a basic overview, but they don't always cover everything.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/">JenkovTutorials</a></br>
        <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/index.html">Jenkov Java Basics</a></br>
        <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/javafx/index.html">Jenkov JavaFX</a> (aka graphics)</br>
        <p> This is probably the best online tutorial for learning Java. It covers almost every aspect of the Java starndard library (most of which you don't have to know). The Java Basics Stuff is really comprehensive and there are good tutorials on graphics if you're interested in that. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/">Robert Sedgwick: Programming in Java</a></br>
        <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/chapter1.pdf">Chapter 1</a></br>
        <p> If you're interested in a college level coruse on Java this is for you. It has the best explanation of OOP. There are also a lot of practice problems and projects. </p> 
        <p> <b>Note</b>: This is only a "book site" and chapter 1. You can find the full book online if you know what I mean... </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p> 
There are probably a bunch of other courses you can find on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MITOpenCourseWare</a>, or <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>.</br>
You can use them if you want but they're pretty cringe in my opinion.

## Practicing Java
<ul>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://codingbat.com/java">Coding Bat</a>
        <p> This site is really bad. Everyone else recommends it, so it's probably kinda good. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://tech.tonyballantyne.com/java/99-java-problems/">99 Java Problems</a>
        <p> I used these when I was learning Haskell, but they're language agnostic. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>
        <p> This is the best site for practicing your skills in any language. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>
        <p> This site is more advanced. It's used by a lot of competitive programmers. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>
        <p> HackerRank but way harder. </p>
    </li>
</ul>

## Robot Code
<ul>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://frcdocs.wpi.edu/en/latest/docs/software/vscode-overview/index.html">FRC Documentation</a>
        <p> There probably isn't a better resource for learning robot code than the official documentation itself. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.thecompassalliance.org/programming">Compass Alliance</a>
        <p> This is a little bit outdated but I remember it being really helpful in the past. </p>
    </li>
