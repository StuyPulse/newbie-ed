# Lesson 7 - Trial By Fire
A lesson to be remembered, taught by yours truly!

### Before we proceed...
This lesson will not be like any other lesson that you have been taught thus far. This is largely due to the fact that it will not be a lesson at all. Today, all of you will be putting your wonderful Stuy heads together to create something all by yourselves! That's right, you heard me. All by yourselves! That means that while oldbies will be present in every small group today, they will be taking *minimal* action to help you.
After I'm finished here with all of you, you will be splitting into your breakout rooms from last week, only this time you'll be splitting *again* into even smaller groups. All will be explained, save your questions.

### Today's activity will combine...
#### 1. Inheritance
Each breakdown group will be splitting into two smaller groups. Each group will be responsible for coding a class from scratch, but one group will be coding a superclass, while the other will be coding a subclass. Details on what exactly both classes will do will be listed... later down the line.
#### 2. Git
Each small group will be initializing a new branch for their work. Students are expected to *commit regularly*, and not all at once at the end. Failure to comply will mean failure to receive credit (more on that later as well). Use your SAT vocabulary to make meaningful commit messages, and make sure to keep your branches clean and clutter-free. This assignment has been designed in a way that should prevent any merge conflicts.
#### 3. Teamwork
Believe it or not, you're part of a team now: Team Stuypulse. Over the next however many years, you'll be working alongside both the brightest and somehow stupidest students attending the prestigious Stuyvesant Academy. Your eyes will drown in the color red, you'll pull all-nighters upstate in a 4 star hotel as 20 degree winds blow outside, you'll jam your head into a wall trying to understand the ridiculous team traditions, but most importantly? Chances are you'll meet the kind of friends that'll last a lifetime, so make the most of it. I'm sorry that with everything going on you can't properly experience robotics as it was meant to be experienced, late night pizza and everything, but stay strong! We'll get through it, we always do.
#### 4. Teamwork (Again)
Returning to the topic of teamwork itself, the assignment will be completed by two small groups that will **not have access to the other's work until they themselves are finished**. That means you will be coding a superclass with incomplete methods that you will be entrusting to your subclass partners, while the subclass group will be praying that the superclass folks will know what they're doing for long enough to properly implement their parent methods and fields. Fun, right?

### So... what's the activity itself?
Great question! I have a really bad answer saved just for you. See, halfway through writing out this exercise I realized that the activity itself that I had in mind was not exactly one that even involved super and subclasses.

### Welcome back.
I went to go drink some water and talk to some friends, I no longer remember what I was writing about. But it doesn't matter, since I've decided that I'm going to be ad libbing from here on out lemme just leave myself some notes so I remember what to talk about.

- Point
- Triangle
- Driver
- Good luck

### Good luck!
