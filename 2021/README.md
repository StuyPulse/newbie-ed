# Newbie Ed. 2021

Here lives all the stuff for the 2021 newbie ed. 

## Format 

Each dirctory is organized by lesson, with the following format: `<number>_<lesson>`. <br />
Inside each lesson there is `README.md` with an assignment. <br />
For each assingment please make a folder for yourself like so: `<first>_<last>`. <br />
If a lesson has parts they should be named so: `<letter>_<sublesson>`. <br />
