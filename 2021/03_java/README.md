# Hello, welcome to Java Basics
Here's what you will be doing for this exercise (Use the terminal so you can practice)
1. create a folder in 03_java and name it `first_last` (Ex: `pak_lau`)
2. go inside your folder and create a file named `Main.java`(Your file system should match the one in the README for 2021 directory)
3. copy and paste this into your file
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```
4. compile and run the code (don't forget to save)
5. create a bunch of variables (of different data types), and print them out
6. using one of the int variables you created, create a for loop where you print the variable and then increment it 10 times.
7. run your code make sure it works, if not, assemble your rubber duckies (group leaders) and bug them to debug with you
8. Now edit that for loop and make it so that it only prints the even numbers
9. repeat step 7
10. push this code onto the github repo, please pull before pushing though
