## Assignment 

Create a folder using the following naming convention: `<first>_<last>`
cd into the folder and create a file called `README.md`. This is the file that github will show when you look at a folder. 
In the `README.md` file put your first and last name as a header like so: 
```
# <first> <last>
```
Below you may put anything that you want to share (does not necessarily have to be about you). Or you may put nothing. 
Finally commit and push your changes. 

## Extra 

The `README.md` file is in a special markdown format that is compatiable with HTML. 
You can read more about markdown [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). 

If you feel like spicing up your markdown file then try adding an image or maybe some links...

## Example 

Check out [john_doe](john_doe). 

# Two Factor Authentication (2fa)

In order to commit to our organization you'll need to have 2fa enabled. You can read about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication). <br /><br />
There are two ways to commit with 2fa enabled: 
1. Personal Access Token: this is a password that will replace your normal password. more into [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). 
2. SSH key: this uses a different protocool for the remote repo called [ssh](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys). more info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
